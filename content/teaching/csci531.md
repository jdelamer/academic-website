This course introduce the fundamentals of Reinforcement learning (RL) and Deep learning techniques. The course cover the Tabular solution methods, such as the finite Markov Decision Processes and Temporal-Difference learning. It will also cover approximation solution methods, as on-policy and off-policy approximations. By the end of the course, new deep-learning techniques are introduced.
